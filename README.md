<b>Technologies Used</b>

- CSS3 – Layout and styling
- JavaScript – Game logic and DOM manipulation
  
<b>How It Works</b>
1. Event listeners detect player clicks on the three options
2. Computer move is randomly chosen (e.g., using Math.random())
3. Game logic compares player vs computer moves to determine the outcome
4. DOM update shows the moves and result, and updates the score
5. Reset clears results and score for a new game
